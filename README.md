## Dataset

### Data Statement
There is a local consensus that on-wiki use of the data acquired through this campaign should be limited to the immediate scope of Wikibench. A strong consensus should be established prior to any on-wiki use outside this research project.

The data acquired as part of this campaign is not intended for other uses and may be inappropriate or unsuitable for many purposes. In particular, it is not a representative sample of edits made to the English Wikipedia, nor is it intended as such.

See the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tzusheng/sandbox/Wikipedia:Wikibench/Campaign:Editquality#All_labeled_data) for more details.
